 <h1 style="text-align:center;"> About me </h1>

 <p style="text-align:center;">  Welcome to my page! My name is Shamarah Cropper, I'm in 10th grade
    attending an amazing school in Atlanta, and I am a person who'd very passionate about learning
    the all ins and out of coding. Some of my biggest vaules are determination, courage, and 
    resilence because without having such values, a person will forever be stuck in a box and   
    I am strongly against staying confined in a box because everyone is met to break out of the 
    starting box. I enjoy many things such as playing the bass guitar, spending time with family and 
        friends, and doing things that challenge me such as club competitions and going to 
        youth events that force me to use my voice. I am a hardworking person who's working on 
        dedicated to constantly improving aspects about myself because life is a journey of growing
        and improving. </p>
