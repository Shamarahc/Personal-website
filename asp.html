    <p1> The tech industry is an industy that is both inclusive and seeminly exclusive at 
        the same time. Althought the tech industry is built off of countless innovators who constantly 
        share ideas to make the technology landscape more advancaed, making the tech feild inclusive in 
        that aspect, the tech feild is also lacking in diversity when it comes to women and people of color. 
        I inspire to become a person that young girls will be able to look up to when they want to enter 
        the tech field so that they will be able to see that they too can do it. In order to do this, I will
        become a software enginner who works in some aspect of tech weather its programming games, helping 
        build AI and robots, or making websites and then using my experience that I'll gather to start a program
        focused on encourging girls and POC to enter the tech field.
